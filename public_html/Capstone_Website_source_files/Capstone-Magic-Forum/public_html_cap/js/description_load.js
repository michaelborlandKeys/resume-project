/*  

Basically, I combined part of 2 assignments from my CIS-320 class to achieve the functionality i wanted for this function,
 with 3 minor modifications to get the function below.
 The function attaches to a button, so every time this code is run a button is clicked.
 This JavaScript/ JQuery function takes the descriptions below and puts it in paragraph tags and 
 shows it to the user when the button is clicked. the same function also hides the texts and empties the paragraph, 
 so when its clicked again, only one description shows up not two copies of the same one. 
 There will be several iterations of this function, in this document, 
 just with different descriptions being called attached to different buttons on different pages.
